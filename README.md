  Hi, I’m @FrancoisSuzeau, i am a DevOps engineer at Michelin, in the manufacturing IT department.

  I’m interested in many things but mostly into space science and space technologies. Most of my days are spent for learning astronomy and celestial mechanics.
In order to practice my fresh knowledge, i decided to learn modern OpenGL. It is my first real big project (all of my university project were quiet short and not really complex).

During my internship, I was working on an entire C#/Blazor project with the full stack tool like Gitlab CI/CD and SonarQube.
