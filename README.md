  Hi, I’m @FrancoisSuzeau, i am computer student at Clermont Ferrand University in France and newly graduaded at the bachelor's level. 
I plan to continue my studies in master to reach the Developement, 3D and Artificial Intelligence course.

  I’m interested in many things but mostly into space science and space technologies. Most of my days are spent for learning astronomy and celestial mechanics.
In order to practice my fresh knowledge, i decided to learn modern OpenGL. It is my first real big project (all of my university project were quiet short and not really complex).
